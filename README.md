# EECS40_JesseAngelo_Assignment2
This calculator program/app was made by Jesse Angelo Pangilinan 65803943.
The program follows the same way as explained in the Assignment2.pdf on Canvas.
The "statement.txt" is found in app/java/eecs40/assignment2/statemnet.txt.
The program was tested with an android phone and not a virtual phone because the computer I used to make this program doesn't have an intel chip. The computer uses an AMD chip.
